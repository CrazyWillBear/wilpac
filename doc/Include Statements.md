# Include Statements

Include statements should be organized into 2 sections:
- The upper section contains all default libraries (the ones that use <>).
- The lower section should contain all usermade libraries (the ones that use "").

They should both be organized alphabetically, and the sections should be separated by a single breakline. To see an example, reference the top of `main.cpp`.

# `wilpac`

# WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

## NEWS:
- I plan to add 'publish' option for Makefile which will compile using optimizations
- I want this to work on all Unix systems, so buckets for different OSs might be implemented
- Work has stagnated due to a very busy schedule on my part - I plan to continue working on `wilpac`, however it will be slow.

## Summary
`wilpac` is a package manager, designed for Unix operating systems. For now however, it functions as a package manager for exclusively Linux.

## Credits
Not many are due honestly, although Stack Overflow is always helpful ;).

## License
I chose the MPL 2.0 because it isn't as strict as the GPL (GPL makes you document how you changed the code and such), while still maintaining that you must use the same license, disclose me as the source, and give a copyright and license notice.

## How to Use
Don't! This is unfinished, but if you would like to run it, just use `make run`.

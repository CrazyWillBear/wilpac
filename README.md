# wilpac

# WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

## Summary
'wilpac' is a package manager, hopefully to be used in wilcus. For now however, it functions as a package manager for Linux.

## Credits
Not many are due honestly, although Stack Overflow is always helpful ;).

## License
I chose the MPL 2.0 because it isn't as strict as the GPL (GPL makes you document how you changed the code and such), while still maintaining that you must use the same license, disclose me as the source, and give a copyright and license notice.

## How to Use
Don't! This is unfinished, but if you would like to run it, just use `make`.

# `wilpac`

# WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

## NEWS:
- I want this to work on all UNIX systems, so buckets for different OSs might be implemented
- Work has stagnated due to a very busy schedule on my part - I plan to continue working on `wilpac`, however it will be slow

## Summary
`wilpac` is a package manager, designed for UNIX operating systems. For now however, it functions as a package manager for exclusively Linux.
